"Double double, toil and trouble"

A collaboration that did radial velocity extraction and light curve analysis on double-lined eclipsing binaries in the 
Kepler APOGEE overlap. Meredith Rawls wrote the program to extract radial velocities from a double-lined binary star 
spectrum using the Broadening Function technique (2014-2015, based loosely on Rucinski's BFall_IDL.pro). Diana Windemuth 
wrote KEBLAT for analyzing light curve data from Kepler. Joni Marie Clark Cunningham wrote BF_area.py that calculates the 
area underneath the BF curves, takes their ratio, and plots HR diagrams resulting from the combined analysis.
